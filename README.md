# Soil-Analysis-and-Crop-Recommendation
Description

This project is an AI-driven soil analysis and crop recommendation system that utilizes IoT sensors and machine learning to help farmers select the most suitable crops based on soil conditions. The system collects real-time soil data using advanced sensors and processes it with a machine learning model to generate recommendations.

Features

Collects Soil Data: Measures NPK, pH, humidity, temperature, and rainfall.
AI-Based Recommendations: Uses machine learning to suggest the best crops.
IoT Integration: Uses ESP32 to transmit data to the cloud.
User-Friendly Interface: Farmers can access insights through a web app.
Fast and Accurate Processing: Ensures timely and precise crop suggestions.
